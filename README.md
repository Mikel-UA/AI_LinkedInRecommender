# AI_LinkedInRecommender
Python script for identifying and matching LinkedIn users based on their listed skills. The script uses **TensorFlow** for machine learning to calculate and rank the **similarity between users and a set of desired skills**. It's designed to assist LinkedIn users in finding and connecting with professionals who share similar expertise or interests.

## How to Use:
1. Load your scrapped user data into the JSON file (e.g., "linkedin_data.json").
2. Set your desired skills
3. Run the script to calculate user similarities based on desired skills.
4. Adjust the value of k to specify how many similar users you want to retrieve.
5. Review the printed recommendations to find LinkedIn users with similar skills and interests.

*The web scraping functionality was removed from this code due to concerns that it could be potentially misused for spamming purposes. I want to ensure the responsible and ethical use of the code and data, and therefore, decided to focus solely on the core recommendation system.*
