# AI_LinkedInRecommender
Python script for identifying and matching LinkedIn users based on their listed skills. The script uses TensorFlow for machine learning to calculate and rank the similarity between users and a set of desired skills. It's designed to assist LinkedIn users in finding and connecting with professionals who share similar expertise or interests.

How to Use:
Load your scrapped user data into the JSON file (e.g., "linkedin_data.json").
Set your desired skills
Run the script to calculate user similarities based on desired skills.
Adjust the value of k to specify how many similar users you want to retrieve.
Review the printed recommendations to find LinkedIn users with similar skills and interests.

The web scraping functionality was removed from this code due to concerns that it could be potentially misused for spamming purposes. I want to ensure the responsible and ethical use of the code and data, and therefore, decided to focus solely on the core recommendation system.
